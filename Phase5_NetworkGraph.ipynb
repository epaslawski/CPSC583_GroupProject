Figure 1. shows that as we increase stimulation from A to D, the arousal response gets higher, although the degree to how much varies between significantly between the two. The conclusion from this is little to moderate high stimulation arouses introverts more than extroverts, however a high degree of stimulation shows sharp decline in arousal with introverts.

We used the same standardized form to keep it consistent between each member and merged the data altogether at the end of our data collection.

Within the visualizations, the average mood is represented by the size of the node and label (as well as edge length in the individual graphs), category of people by color, and the extroversion or member of the group is represented by a different shape (since we all have different extroversion levels). \n"

    "I kind of expected the results to vary between different categories of people, but the averages seem to be almost consistent through different categories. I’m surprised that school is the highest one (by only a small amount) but I think this was due to the fact that I was working on a fun project that week. Family and friends are also similar in that I feel much more comfortable to converse with them about hobbies, school, etc. I don’t really interact with strangers much in person, but I have had conversations through discord for matters about school, homework help and I always feel happy to help some stranger over discord. I feel that my extroversion levels have not really affected my mood across different interactions with different people; more so that they are about equal, and they don’t really reach the extreme mood rating nor the lowest mood rating across the categories.

    "Luke associates negative stimulation with schoolwork, and this result is reflected both in his reflection as well as his overall score in the charts. Whereas Shaina showed the opposite result, where school interactions were her highest mood category due to her having more “fun” interactions during that week. With Shaina being the introvert, it is not unsurprising to have higher than average mood after each interaction since the stimulation would have been the right zone where there is high stimulation but not high enough to be overstimulating and negative.\n",

    "Erin made a comment that she experienced a surprisingly high mood from strangers, perhaps she encountered people who created a large amount of stimulation. Jessie’s average mood ratings across all categories were more or less the very similar. \n",
    "In conclusion, it is hard to answer our research question with our data set. Our mood ratings in each category were similar and there are no obvious outliers. As well, we have 3 categories where we did not all record conversations with- Other, Work and Stranger, so we cannot easily compare extroverts and introverts. We also have to keep in mind that because of the pandemic, each of us don’t have as much interaction with a variety of people compared to before the pandemic occurred. \n"
